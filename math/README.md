## [Statistics](stats.ipynb)
This explains what the range, mean, median and mode of a list of numbers are.
The exercises are to compute each of the measures.

Computing the median requires sorting.
All other exercises can be done with just basic Python constructs.
The mode can be more efficiently computed with additional data structures.
