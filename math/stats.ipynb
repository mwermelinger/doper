    "Statistics is the branch of mathematics that deals with collecting, analysing\n",
    "and presenting data. Statistics are used to inform most human activity,\n",
    "whether it's scientific research, business management or government policy.\n",
    "Statistics are used in advertisements and in the press,\n",
    "sometimes to influence our opinion.\n",
    "It's increasingly important to have some knowledge of statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following exercises ask you to implement simple statistical measures\n",
    "that summarise the collected data.\n",
    "For all exercises, the collected data is a non-empty list of integers.\n",
    "They can represent daily sales of a product, daily temperatures or rainfall,\n",
    "salaries of surveyed people, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're taking an algorithms and data structures course, you may wish to\n",
    "measure the run-time of your functions and analyse their complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1 Variability\n",
    "A simple measure of how much the data varies is its **range**:\n",
    "the difference between the largest and the smallest value.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are at least two ways of implementing this measure,\n",
    "by doing two passes or one pass over the data."
