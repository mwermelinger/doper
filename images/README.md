# Image Processing

This folder contains the following Jupyter notebooks.

1. [Introduction](1-introduction.ipynb):
   This explains how raster images and their pixels can be represented and
   introduces a simple image loading/saving library used for all exercises.
1. [Puzzles](2-puzzles.ipynb): These exercises involve revealing an image
   hidden among apparently completely random pixels.
1. [Pixels](3-pixel.ipynb): These exercises involve modifying individual pixels
   to change or remove the colours of an image.
1. [Image](4-image.ipynb): These exercises involve modifying groups of pixels to
   rotate, flip and blur an image.

The exercises require only basic programming constructs:
assignments, integer expressions, if-statements, for-loops (possibly nested),
arrays, matrices (2D arrays), and functions.

Some exercises require generating random numbers but they indicate which
built-in function should be used.
