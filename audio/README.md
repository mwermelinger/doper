# Audio Processing

[![nbviewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyter/design/master/logos/Badges/nbviewer_badge.svg)](https://nbviewer.org/github/mwermelinger/doper/tree/master/audio)

This folder contains the following Jupyter notebooks.

1. [Mono sound](1-mono.ipynb) explains how mono sound can be represented as
   a list of floating-point numbers and how to generate silence and noise.
   The exercise asks you to fade out a clip of sound.
   You are given two functions to play and visualise sound.
2. [Stereo sound](2-stereo.ipynb) explains how to represent stereo sound
   with two lists of numbers. The exercises involve panning to give the impression
   the sound source is moving and removing the vocals from a song.

The exercises require only basic programming constructs
to manipulate lists of numbers.

You will need to trust the notebooks to play the sounds.
If you're using the classic web browser Jupyter interface,
open a notebook and then select the 'Trust notebook' option in the 'File' menu.

If you want to read the notebooks and play the sounds without installing Jupyter,
click on the nbviewer button above.
