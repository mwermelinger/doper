# Domain-Oriented Programming Exercises
This repository is a collection of programming exercises related to
[image processing](images/README.md), [biology](biology/README.md) and,
in the future, other domains. You don't know any domain knowledge to attempt
these exercises: I provide all the necessary information. However,
I'm not an expert in any domain. The explanations are based on my own
(possibly incorrect and definitely incomplete) understanding.

The exercises are presented in Python, using Jupyter notebooks,
to interleave code and explanations and
to take advantage of their multimedia capabilities, but the exercises
can be adapted to other languages and programming environments.

## Contributing
If you spot a mistake or have a suggestion for a new exercise
or for improving an existing exercise, please submit an
[issue](https://github.com/mwermelinger/doper/issues).

If you use these exercises in a classroom or code club, please start a new
['show and tell' discussion](https://github.com/mwermelinger/doper/discussions/categories/show-and-tell)
to describe your experience and how you delivered them,
so that we can learn from you.

Many thanks in advance for your contributions!
