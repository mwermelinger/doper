# Domain-Oriented Programming Exercises
This repository is a collection of programming exercises related to
image and audio processing and, in the future, other domains.

The exercises are presented in Python, using Jupyter notebooks,
to take advantage of their multimedia capabilities, but the exercises
can be adapted to other languages and programming environments.

I'm not an expert in any of these domains. The explanations are based on my own
(possibly incorrect and definitely incomplete) understanding of them.
