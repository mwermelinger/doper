# Biology

This folder includes the following Jupyter notebooks.

## [DNA](dna.ipynb)
This explains how to represent DNA and RNA with strings. Exercises include:

- Simulating biological processes, e.g. RNA transcription and protein production.
- Analyse what kind of organism a DNA sample belongs to.
- Determine which suspect best matches the DNA found at a crime scene.

You will need to know some string processing operations to solve the exercises.
Some exercises require further data structures, but this is indicated.
